Hi <%= @user.first_name %>,

Welcome to FamilyTales! My name is Beatrice and it's my job to make you feel like home!

We help moms capture, organize, and share their baby's special moments in a storybook. This can be in the form of text stories, or pictures. In the near future, you will also be able to print off your personalized storybook as a keepsake, or as a gift to others.

To start off, confirm your login to FamilyTales: <%= @url %>

We want to build the best site for all your special moments and we are rolling out new features all the time. Feel free to contact me at this email if you have any questions, or just want to chat! 

Enjoy,
Beatrice
